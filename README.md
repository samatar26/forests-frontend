## Notes

Current issues:

- If you refresh on the details page, you get a 404 displayed. I think I know how to fix this, but out of time.
- Unfortunately had no time for the bonus features as I spent some time on the infrastructure to get the project deployed.
- Should really handle loading and error states. But there's only so much time in the day :sob:
